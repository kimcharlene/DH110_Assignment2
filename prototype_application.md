# Prototype Application

[Return to README](https://github.com/kimcharlene/DH110_Assignment2/blob/main/README.md)

After conducting our preliminary research on existing time management tools and interviews on current thoughts on their effectiveness, here we present our prototype application to suggest a better alternative.

## Final Wireframe

![Wireframe](https://github.com/kimcharlene/DH110_Assignment2/blob/main/wireframe.png?raw=true)

Above is a prototype of our application designed on Figma. Below we will go into specific goals and expected user flows form the application.

The first screen shows the main screen which lists all the current assignments, as well as its record for past assignments.

The second screen shows a screenshot of the screen when one assignment is expanded for more information or interaction with that particular card.

The third screen shows the screen for creating a new assignment entirely, and what types of fields the user can fill in.

## User Flow

![User Flow](https://github.com/kimcharlene/DH110_Assignment2/blob/main/user-flow.png?raw=true)

This flow chart explains how the user will interact with the interface, and what functionalities and features would be available on the application.

When the user starts the application (via. reminder notification or clicking the application), the user will be presented with the Assignments tab with a list of previously added assignments. The user can choose to view more details on these assignments, start/complete them, or add more assignments.

The trackable information of an assignment include: the name, due date/time, subtasks, start date/time, and reminder settings of each assignment.

## User Journey

![User Journey](https://github.com/kimcharlene/DH110_Assignment2/blob/main/user-journey.png?raw=true)

Here is an example of a user experience and journey while using this app. In this visualization, we are analyzing a persona of a busy student who has a difficult time committing to start work in various scenarios and stages of their workflow. In each phase, we discuss the actions, pain points, emotions, and insight and opportunities by this persona.
