# Existing Product Research

[Return to README](https://github.com/kimcharlene/DH110_Assignment2/blob/main/README.md)

In this section, we summarize major systems and products used for time and task management that are currently in use by the market.
The purpose of this research to is to find what methodologies and features are desirable in a good management tool and to pick out what features could be better improved, to ultimately inform our design decisions for our application.

### Digital

*Personal Use*
- Microsoft Outlook (Email, calendar, and task management)
- Google Calendar (Calendar, basic scheduling and task management)
- Trello (Task management via visual project boards)​​  
- Todoist (Task management via to-do list)
- Notion (Task management via note-taking)

*Team Use*
- Slack, Asana, Jira, ClickUp (Task management, via team communication)
    
### Analog

*Paper*

- Sticky notes/TO-DO lists

> This method is one of the most preliminary analog time management
> systems. While it may be difficult to keep multiple notes together,
> you can stick them up to different notebooks and surfaces/walls.

Day Planner (easy to store and keep in contained spiral/bound)

> -   Bullet journals maximize your control on what to put on the pages but also gives minimal guidance and structure.
>     
> -   Planners can be structured by time blocks (daily by hour, monthly, yearly spreads), which make it easier to keep track of and visualize time and events over time.

*Clock/Timers*

Basic clocks and timers (to time one task at a time)

> While good for timing tasks one at a time, no way of recording events and need to use memorization for upcoming events. Perfect to use in tandem with other management tools.

Pomodoro timers

> Timing work periods (i.e. 25 min) and rest/break periods (i.e. 5 min) allow for meaningful and efficient work periods while also accounting for healthy balanced rest. Having these tools to assist in time these periods streamline the Pomodoro study technique.

### Features to Implement
Upon analyzing these existing systems and practices, we want to incorporate a version of a task scheduling and organization system where you can keep track of task information, deadlines, duration, and other crucial details in one system and application, so that the user can spend less time recalling these items in their head. By reducing this clutter, we hope that the user can feel more equipped and ready to focus energy and efforts on their major priorities and eliminate any bottlenecks from task management to streamline the process.
