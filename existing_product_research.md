# Existing Product Research

[Return to README](https://github.com/kimcharlene/DH110_Assignment2/blob/main/README.md)

In this section, we summarize our research of major systems and products that currently dominate the market for time and task management.
The purpose of this research is to determine the most effective and desirable methodologies and features in a good management tool. We also seek to pick out what features could be better improved, to ultimately shape and inform our design decisions for our application.

### Digital

*Personal Use*
- **Microsoft Outlook**: Offering a comprehensive suite for email, calendar, and task management, Microsoft Outlook has established itself as a formidable tool in the digital workspace.
- **Google Calendar**: An indispensable tool for calendar management, basic scheduling, and task management, Google Calendar provides an efficient and widely-used solution.
- **Trello**: Trello's visual project boards have redefined task management for many users, offering a unique and intuitive approach to organizing and tracking tasks.
- **Todoist**: Task management via to-do lists is at its best with Todoist, which simplifies the process of keeping track of tasks and priorities.
-** Notion**: Combining task management with note-taking capabilities, Notion offers a versatile and flexible solution for personal organization.

*Team Use*
- **Slack, Asana, Jira, ClickUp**: These robust tools, with their task management features and team communication capabilities, cater to the needs of collaborative and team-based projects, each with its unique strengths.
    
### Analog

*Paper*

- **Sticky notes/TO-DO Lists**

> This method is one of the most preliminary analog time management systems, providing simplicity and flexibility. While it may be difficult to keep multiple notes together, you can stick them up to different notebooks and surfaces/walls.

- **Day Planner** 

> -   Bullet journals maximize your control on what to put on the pages but also gives minimal guidance and structure.
> -   Easy to store and carry around, and to keep in a contained spiral/bound.
> -   Planners can be structured by time blocks (daily by hour, monthly, yearly spreads), which make it easier to keep track of and visualize time and events over time.

*Clock/Timers*

- **Basic Clocks and Timers**

> While good for timing tasks one at a time, no way of recording events and need to use memorization for upcoming events. Perfect to use in tandem with other management tools.

- **Pomodoro Timers**

> Timing work periods (i.e. 25 min) and rest/break periods (i.e. 5 min) allow for meaningful and efficient work periods while also accounting for healthy balanced rest. Having these tools to assist in time these periods streamline the Pomodoro study technique.

### Features to Implement
Upon analyzing these existing systems and practices, we want to incorporate a version of a task scheduling and organization system where you can keep track of task information, deadlines, duration, and other crucial details in one system and application, to reduce the cognitive load of the user spending time recalling these items in their head. By reducing this clutter, we hope that the user can feel more equipped and ready to focus energy and efforts on their major priorities and eliminate any bottlenecks from task management to streamline the process.
