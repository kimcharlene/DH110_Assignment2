The prompt of the assignment is as follows:

Working in small groups of 2-3 people, design a prototype application designed to help college students with time and task management.
 
Review the design of existing time management tools, both digital and analog. 
Talk with at least three students who are not in the class about time management and their experience and habits as students. 

Conduct an iterative design process to articulate application functionality, information architecture, and user personas and user journey that describes a time management application that is specific to the needs and preferences of college students. 

Document all steps of the process. Publish your documentation using GitHub pages. Each individual should submit the URL for the website.
