# Interviews

[Return to README](https://github.com/kimcharlene/DH110_Assignment2/blob/main/README.md)

Here is a template of interviews conducted before developing our prototype application, to inquire about their thoughts on time management and their experience and habits as students.
In this section, you will find what we used as an **introduction** and **outro**, as well as **three sections** with questions and answers from three different students.
The interview asks about their **user persona**, their **connection to the topic**, and their **previous experiences**.

## Introduction
Greeting:
- Hello / Good morning / Good afternoon, <user’s name>!
- My name is \<your name\> and I am a \<some humble title\>.
- Thank you for joining this session! How are you?

Explaining the goal:
- <User’s name>, you were chosen because we believe your feedback can help to <purpose, goals, how you’ll use results, etc. >

“Rules of the game”:
- <User’s name>, I’m going to ask you a series of questions that I want you to answer honestly. Frankly speaking, it might seem like an exam, but it isn’t.
- There are no wrong and right answers today — any feedback is welcome. Please think aloud about everything you do.

## Interview 1

**User persona (easy to answer questions to get to know the user better).**

1. What do you study?

>  *Global Studies, Digital Humanities minor*

2. Please describe to me your typical day.

> *I usually start my day by taking the bus to campus. Depending on my class schedule, I will go to the YRL to clock in for work or go to class. If it is a Tuesday or Thursday, I will go to a club meeting after my last class/clocking out of work. Once I am done with all of my day-to-day commitments, I will go to the gym before walking back to my apartment. On some days, I will stop by Trader Joe’s to pick up a few ingredients since I usually cook once I am back at home.*

**Connection with the topic**

3. How many hours per day do you spend on homework or school related projects?

> *2-4 hours*

4. Do you find that you often have trouble finding the time to complete your homework or keep on track while completing it?

> *No*

    
5. Describe how you typically complete your homework, specifically how you organize time to complete assignments.
> *I usually go to a place where I am almost completely alone and dedicate giant blocks of time (usually after I finish work and classes or after the gym) to finish assignment after assignment.*

6. What are the most common impediments to your studying? 

> *Procrastination, access to a quiet study place.*

**Previous experience**

7. Do you take any methods to improve your time management? If so, describe them to me. If yes, follow up with: has this been effective when you’ve implemented this method?

> *I usually divide up all of my assignments into smaller, manageable tasks. For example, if I have a 10 page essay to write, then I will type each section in separate documents so I feel less anxious to start the paper since it appears less intimidating as a series of smaller tasks instead of one big task. Yes, this method has been effective for me since my biggest issue is usually just starting my work.*

8. Have you ever used an app or website to aid your time management? Yes, 

> *Notion*

9. What are your main issues with <sites/apps/other-means mentioned before>?
    
> *Notion has a range of capabilities, which means it can be used as a time management tool but isn’t specifically designed as one. Sometimes, I spend too much time doing trivial things, such as fixing my template than being productive.*

## Interview 2

**User persona (easy to answer questions to get to know the user better).**

1. What do you study?

>  *I study cognitive science at UCLA. I’m also minoring in Digital Humanities.*

2. Please describe to me your typical day.

> *I commute to campus via bus, attend lectures, meet friends, and go home. Some days I go to work (I am a part time cashier at this food court near my home).*

**Connection with the topic**

3. How many hours per day do you spend on homework or school related projects?

> *I spend around 4 hours per day on homework.*

4. Do you find that you often have trouble finding the time to complete your homework or keep on track while completing it?

> *Yes. Sometimes I underestimate the level of difficulty of my assignments and end up spending the majority of the day completing it. While I can divide my work up into different days, I prefer finishing it in one sitting.*

    
5. Describe how you typically complete your homework, specifically how you organize time to complete assignments.
> *I use Notion to organize my tasks. Then, I start with the ones with approaching deadlines. I don’t really have a time management system. If I don’t complete a specific task on the day it's planned, I move it to the next day.*

6. What are the most common impediments to your studying? 
> *If I'm listening to music, I end up getting distracted. Other than that if the assignment doesn't seem interesting, I end up scouring through Instagram.*

**Previous experience**

7. Do you take any methods to improve your time management? If so, describe them to me. If yes, follow up with: has this been effective when you’ve implemented this method?

> *I currently don’t have any methods to improve my time management. I tend to move on to the next task once I’ve either completely finished or finished the majority of the assignment I started. This works well when I start early, but if I start closer to the deadline, I end up pushing other assignments to the next day. This repeats almost every week.*

8. Have you ever used an app or website to aid your time management? Yes, 

> *The only app I use is Notion, I don't really use it for time management.*

9. What are your main issues with <sites/apps/other-means mentioned before>?
    
> *An issue I have with Notion is that I don’t explore the different layouts or templates that may include a time management system because it has too many features it feels overwhelming. I find myself reverting to the basic/blank template where I simply write out my to-do list in a laundry list style.*
